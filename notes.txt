- first run view.py
- this will generate the three main players:
- 1: the target
- 2: the seed
- 3: the adult
- these three central players are created using
  monochrome.py and view.py

- then use growing_adult.py, growing_seed.py, growing_target.py
- these use the data generated by monochrome.py and view.py
